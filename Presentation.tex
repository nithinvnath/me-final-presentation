\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Deduplication}

\begin{frame}{Deduplication}{}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    Large amount of data stored in cloud storage.
  }
  \item {
    Service providers need to employ space saving techniques to keep cost down.
  }
	\begin{definition}
		Deduplication is the technique that enables storage providers to store a single copy of the data
		regardless of how many clients has uploaded the same data.
	\end{definition}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Deduplication Example}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Deduplication in Action}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    Alice uploads a file $M$ to the server $S$.
    \pause % The slide will pause after showing the first item
  }
  \item {   
	 Bob requests to upload his copy of the same file $M$ to $S$.
  }
  % You can also specify when the content should appear
  % by using <n->:
  \item<3-> {The server identifies
	that $M$ is already stored and simply updates the metadata associated with $M$ to show
	that the file is owned by both Alice and Bob.
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Deduplication Types}
\begin{frame}{Deduplication Types}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    Based on granularity
    \pause % The slide will pause after showing the first item
    \begin{enumerate}
		\item \textit{File-level deduplication}
		\item \textit{Block-level deduplication}
	\end{enumerate}
	\pause
  }
  \item {   
	 Based on the architecture
	 \pause
	 \begin{enumerate}
	 	\item \textit{Server-side deduplication}
		
		\item \textit{Client-side deduplication}
	\end{enumerate}
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Secure Deduplication}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deduplication along with privacy is a conflicting idea

	\item Users would like their data to be encrypted
	
	\item Storage providers would like to identify the file uploaded by user
		to enable deduplication.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\subsection{History of Secure Deduplication}

\begin{frame}{History of Secure Deduplication}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Convergent Encryption
		\item Proof of Ownership
		\item Message Locked Encryption
		\item DupLESS
		\item Interactive Message Locked Encryption
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Convergent Encryption}
\begin{frame}{Convergent Encryption}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deterministic cryptosystem that produces  identical ciphertext files from identical plaintext files.
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Blocks}
\begin{block}{Block Title}
You can also highlight sections of your presentation in a block, with it's own title
\end{block}
\begin{theorem}
There are separate environments for theorems, examples, definitions and proofs.
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}
Here is an example of an example block.
\end{example}
\end{frame}

% Placing a * after \section means it will not show in the
% outline or table of contents.
\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \alert{first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Outlook
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Something you haven't solved.
    \item
      Something else you haven't solved.
    \end{itemize}
